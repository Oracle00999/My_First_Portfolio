          Flexbox, short for "Flexible Box Layout," is a powerful layout module
          in CSS that allows developers to design responsive, flexible layouts
          with ease. It was introduced to simplify complex layout tasks and make
          it easier to align elements on a webpage, especially when it comes to
          dynamic resizing and reordering. At its core, Flexbox operates on two
          main components: the flex container and the flex items. The container
          is the parent element, and the items are the direct children. By
          applying the display: flex; property to a container, all its child
          elements automatically become flex items, enabling a wide array of
          layout options. One of the key features of Flexbox is its ability to
          distribute space along a single axis (either horizontally or
          vertically).

          Flexbox revolutionized web design by making it easier to create fluid
          and responsive layouts without relying on older, more cumbersome
          techniques like floats or table-based designs. One of the biggest
          advantages of Flexbox is how it simplifies vertical and horizontal
          alignment, which used to be a major headache for developers. By
          controlling the direction, spacing, and alignment of elements with
          just a few properties, Flexbox reduces the need for complex CSS hacks.
